    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Michael Tokuda. I am 18 years old and will be attending Rutgers
      University in the fall of 2024, where I plan to major in Computer Science
      with the goal of graduating in 2027. I have a deep passion for software
      engineering and am excited to further my knowledge and skills in this
      field.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my academic interests, I enjoy staying active and have
      several hobbies. I love weight lifting and running, and I also play
      lacrosse and soccer. These activities not only keep me fit but also teach
      me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. I am eager to bring the same
      dedication and enthusiasm to my studies and future career in software
      engineering.
